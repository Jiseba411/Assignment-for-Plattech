                Under the feckless husbandry of Mr Jones, the Manor Farm has
                fallen into disrepair. Pushed into hardship, the animals decide
                to stage a revolt, and, led by two young pigs, Snowball and
                Napoleon, they overthrow Mr Jones and drive him away from the
                farm. In the subsequent struggle for power, it is Napoleon who
                emerges as a victor: he renames the place "Animal Farm", gets
                rid of his enemies and, by the way he behaves - expecting to be
                glorified above the others and turning the screw on his fellow
                beasts in order to keep them subjugated - begins to resemble
                more and more the former rulers of the farm, the hated humans.

                Written during the Second World War and published in 1945, this
                allegorical novel is a carefully constructed critique of the
                Russian Revolution and a sharp satire on the abuse of power. It
                remains unsurpassed both as a document of its time and as a
                testament to the versatility and creative genius of George
                Orwell.
