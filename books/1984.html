                Ravaged by years of war and civil conflict, Britain has changed
                its name to Airstrip One and became part of Oceania, one of the
                three totalitarian blocks dominating the world - ruled by a
                mysterious leader called Big Brother who keeps the population in
                thrall through strict surveillance and brutal police repression.
                In a society where the individual is suppressed and turned into
                an "unperson" for not conforming, and where not only personal
                thought, but also historical record and language itself are
                constantly being manipulated by the ruling regime, Ministry of
                Truth worker Winston Smith tries to make sense of the rebellious
                thoughts and passions that are stirring inside him, and finds
                himself impotent against the inexorable machine that surrounds
                him and threatens to crush him at any time.

                Arguably the greatest dystopian novel of all time and the most
                influential post-war work of fiction - which enriched the
                English language with words such as "Newspeak", "doublethink"
                and "thoughtcrime" - Nineteen Eighty-Four is a riveting read and
                groundbreaking exploration of mass surveillance, censorship and
                mind control, which has a deep resonance with the world we live
                in today.
