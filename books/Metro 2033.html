                In 2013 the world was devastated by nuclear war, annihilating
                almost all mankind and turning the earth's surface into a
                poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the
                depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered
                a new Dark Age.

                The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised
                underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle
                for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await
                outside.

                Artyom was born in the last days before the fire. Having never
                ventured beyond his Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event
                sparks a desperate mission to the heart of a terrible impending
                threat. His journey takes him from the forgotten catacombs
                beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where his
                actions will determine the fate of mankind.
