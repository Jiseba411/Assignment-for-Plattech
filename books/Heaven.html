                In a Japanese school, we meet a fourteen-year-old boy. Subjected
                to relentless torment for having a lazy eye, he chooses to
                suffer in silence instead of fighting back. The only person who
                understands what he is going through is a female classmate,
                Kojima, who experiences similar treatment at the hands of her
                bullies. Providing each other with consolation at a time in
                their lives when they need it most, the two young friends grow
                closer than ever. But what, ultimately, is the nature of a
                friendship when your shared bound is terror?

                Unfliching yet tender, sharply observed, intimate and
                multi-layered, Heaven stands as yet another dazzling testament
                to Mieko Kawakami's uncontainable talent. Simple but profound,
                there can be little doubt that it has cemented her reputation as
                one of the most important young authors at work today.
